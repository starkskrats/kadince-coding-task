Todo List assignment for Kadince hiring process.

This was built using react + ruby on rails + postgres.
I had a lot of fun with this because these were brand new frameworks and languages for me. There was a bit of a learning curve but coming from a background of plain JavaScript and PHP these tools made a developing a full stack application so much easier. 

Everything functions perfectly according to the requirements. There is one small issue that I faced. I wanted the inital page load to have the All filter selected but I ran into some weird behavior when I added the checked attribute to the All radio button, I believe it is likely due to a JavaScript conflict with bootstrap.
